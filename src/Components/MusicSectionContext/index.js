              No Cameras is inspired by “ride with me” / Nelly. We interpreted
              “ride with me” as as follows: Nelly is explaining how his life
              changes after he becomes rich and famous - he loves certain perks,
              such as having a nice Mercedes, but overall doesn’t enjoy the fact
              that people are treating him differently because of his money. So
              we took this concept and told the story about a random man who is
              newly famous and is now getting treated differently (girls are
              chasing him for his money, his friends are fake etc.). Our
              character realizes that all he wants to do is flee away from the
              cameras, hangout with a simple girl, and grind in the studio until
              he can’t anymore.

            Switch is inspired by a parking ticket. There was a day when one of
            the members of HR Imagination got off of work and found a parking
            ticket on his car. This inconsequential incident ruined his
            afternoon. He then went home and realized there was no beer left in
            the fridge to soothe his nerves. It was just after this moment of
            agitation that he he took a major step back and realized that he
            shouldn't be stressing about such trivial things. There are millions
            of people in the world who live on less than 3 dollars a day and
            here he was brooding about a parking ticket and no beer. He decided
            to "switch" up how he thinks and focus on living a more
            compassionate life rather than spend time worrying about paltry
            problems.

              Confidence vs. Doubt is about one person with two competing
              emotions (confidence and doubt). The person realizes that these
              emotions appear to alternate without one remaining prominent over
              the other. ("There ain't no sunny days without any stormy
              weather"). Confidence says things like "let's escape town" (leave
              doubt behind) "on the first greyhound that you see". The person
              listens and is trying to calm down and focus on achieving his /
              her dreams - "just take your time now, let your emotions all fall
              on down, as you take the crown" ... but then doubt hops into the
              emotional backdrop: "i've been running, running so so long",
              "mother nature always holds you down". Doubt is telling the person
              that he / she has been running after his / her dreams for so long
              and will probably run out of energy or time before he / she gets
              to them. The song continues as this hypothetical character
              witnesses a tumultous war between these two competing emotions.

              Wonderful Conversation is inspired by the book, Wonder (R.J
              Palacio). Wonder is a book that tells a story about a kid who has
              a deformed face and is treated differently by the world because of
              it. What we took from the book is that at the end of the day, as
              cliche as it sounds, it's what is inside that matters. We, as
              humans, should get to know people with an open mind rather than
              myopically judge them based on how they look / dress. This song
              tells a story of a person who encounters a man with a deformity in
              a city. This man pulls the narrator aside and the two have a
              wonderful conversation.
